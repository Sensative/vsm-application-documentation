## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.

## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register GPS_TIME_MAX_AGE

> - Request current value: Send cd (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Device Time Max Age
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Default: 0
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 4294967295
Once this maximum age has passed the device will no longer trust its GPS_TIME and GNSS scans become autonomous.
Also, it will start emitting DEVICE_TIME requests on the LoRaWan network once 80% of this time has passed.
Typically the clock drift is a few seconds per 24 hrs. Gps time should be correct within 30s for good assisted scans.
Outdoor use tends to increase clock drift.


### Register LINKCHECK_TIME

> - Request current value: Send d0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Downlink Timeout
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Min: 300
> - Max: 2592000
> - Default: 86400
Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a downlink.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to unjoined state.
In the unjoined state the applications specified rejoin method will be used.
