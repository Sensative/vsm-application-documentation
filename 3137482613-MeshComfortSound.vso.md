# Application MeshComfortSound


## Generic RutioMesh Module

Generic mesh module allowing both lora wan bridging, network extension or
(with a setting) the device to behave as a leaf only module (which is same as a regular
lorawan module should the device be joined to lorawan network).


## ADR dampening and limiting module

Adaptive LoRaWan data rate dampening and limiter module, allows to limit both adaptability rate and worst data rate / output power.
This is intended for fixed-mount devices where radio conditions are not expected to change rapidly.

Module for package loss / device restart detection
## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis (threshold) it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis (threshold) degrees C,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


Every minute, the unit will take a humidity sample.

At an interval of averageHumidityIntervalMinutes the unit will recalculate the average humidity value.

The device will do a join attempt if it is not joined and if button is pressed.


An NFC field can be applied to manually trigger a join attempt


## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.


## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.


The device will always do a LoRaWan join attempt when powered on (which also includes after a restart)

The unit will update sound levels only when it is joined.

Synchronization interval

Synchronization is a relatively expensive operation, so we avoid doing this frequently
should the unit fall outside the mesh. It is recommended to set this to longer times in
in environments that are relatively static.

Low pass filter factor. 1 = no low-pass filter. 2 = filter factor 1 (fast) ... 10 = very slow.
When the built-in ADR function propose a new power index, this filter factor is employed in a low pass filter.
If the filter value is set to 1 the algorithm will use its proposed new value (if below or at max).

> - UI: Sound Alarm Timeout
> - Unit: minutes

> - Max: 127
> - Min: 2
When a sound threshold has been set (e.g. interrupt driven) and the level exceeds soundMinLevel, the
sound alarm is set and then held active for approximately this number of minutes (+-60s). The randomization
is there in order to avoid synchronous sending of 0 in case multiple sensors picked up the same sound at the same time.

On activation of the alarm it might still generate conflicts over the air (e.g. multiple sensors hearing the same sound
at the same time may collide in the air).

During this time the sound alarm will not retrigger or reset.

> - UI: Sound Threshold
> - Unit: dB (RMS)
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 18
> - Or set to 0 for internally polled sensor operation
> - Default: 0

This can be set to enable a wake-on-sound operation mode, where the threshold value
will make the device wake up automatically when the sound level changes more than the
set dB value (and above the soundMinLevel). This has the advantage of detecting sudden sounds, but has the disadvantage
of an increased power consumption. The default 0 is recommended in most applications.
The effective range is 6-18dB

Set the power index range for fast ADR, LSB = lowest, MSB = highest
Range for each is 16 (DR0/Max power) - 0 (regions best), mixing up
highest and lowest does not matter (firmware always use the highest of the two as the max).
There is a high impact on power consumption to turn this up (lower battery time).
