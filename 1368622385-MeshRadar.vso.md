# Application MeshRadar


## Generic RutioMesh Module

Generic mesh module allowing both lora wan bridging, network extension or
(with a setting) the device to behave as a leaf only module (which is same as a regular
lorawan module should the device be joined to lorawan network).


## ADR dampening and limiting module

Adaptive LoRaWan data rate dampening and limiter module, allows to limit both adaptability rate and worst data rate / output power.
This is intended for fixed-mount devices where radio conditions are not expected to change rapidly.


## Radar Application

This application integrates with the acconeer/sweiot radar solution. It provides lorawan transfer of radar data
with certain thresholds (hysteresis) filters to reduce the LoRaWan traffic as necessary for any given application.


The application enables port forwardning between radar module and LoRaWan for control of the radar module.

The application enables the device to start on NFC field.


Any NFC field can be used to trigger joining the device.


Interval average distance is sampled minutely and uploaded should the value be changed
more than distanceHysteresis


The device will do a join attempt if it is not joined and if button is pressed.


An NFC field can be applied to manually trigger a join attempt


## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.


The device will always do a LoRaWan join attempt when powered on (which also includes after a restart)


## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.


## Application Outputs


### Output amplitude (confirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Radar echo amplitude unit

The amplitude value reported by the radar, uplinked if it has been changed more than amplitudeHysteresis since last uploaded value.

### Output averageDistanceAlarm (confirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Bit mask
> - Values:
> -- 0 = No alarm
> -- 1 = Low alarm active
> -- 2 = High alarm active
> -- 3 = Both alarms active (can happen if low level > high level)

If non-zero one or several distance alarms are active. Note that this is
formulated as measured distance from sensor. For other logic, please manage
this on server side (e.g. base alarms on measured distance to a surface with)
a known sensor distance.

*This alarm is only available if the average function is enabled, and it is not more
responsive than the average function*


### Output batteryPercent (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: % (estimated)

Estimated remaining % of battery in this unit based on measured use time and power for MCU, Radio, Sensors
Position Scans, and potential collateral power use.


### Output distance (confirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 0.01
> - Unit: m (Meters)

The distance value reported by the radar, uplinked if it has been changed more than distanceHysteresis since last uploaded value.
Unit of this is meters, resolution is 0.01 m.

### Output distanceAverage (confirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 0.01
> - Unit: m

Average distance during the interval


### Output nfcContactCount (confirmed)

> - Size: 4 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Integer
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 2^30

Number of contacts made through NFC with this device. Used to force the unit
to send an uplink even if radar is turned off.


### Output occupied (confirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Boolean

Some radar methods may report a occupied value, typically 1 if occupancy is detected, or 0 if occupancy is not detected.


### Output radarDetectionPercentageHourly (confirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1

If the radar does not measure a value, for instance due to parameters thresholds
and nothing is found in range it will report a zero. The below value is a non-zero
measure percentage. An example use is to detect running water in a well or heavy
precipitation blocking the radar from aquiring a stable echo will likely give a lower
detections per hour than if there is no precipitation.

### Output radarVoltage_V (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 0.001
> - Unit: V
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 3.6

System voltage as measured during radar scan. This is reported on 24h interval to give indication
of battery status. Should the voltage drop significantly from the nominal voltage over time (see
product manual), it may indicate either a cold (or very hot) temperature - see temperature reports.
If temperature is normal, and voltage stays low, consider exchanging the battery.

Some fluctuations in voltage is normal in operation, do not react to a single or few offset readings.

### Output temp (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 0.01
> - Unit: C

The temperature uploaded with a resolution of 0.01 C every hour if the measure deviates more than +-1C from the
previous measure. Only for very basic environmental monitoring (e.g. freezing, absurdly hot, etc.).

> Accuracy is limited by accuracy of temperature sensor in the product. Refer to datasheet.

Synchronization interval

Synchronization is a relatively expensive operation, so we avoid doing this frequently
should the unit fall outside the mesh. It is recommended to set this to longer times in
in environments that are relatively static.

Low pass filter factor. 1 = no low-pass filter. 2 = filter factor 1 (fast) ... 10 = very slow.
When the built-in ADR function propose a new power index, this filter factor is employed in a low pass filter.
If the filter value is set to 1 the algorithm will use its proposed new value (if below or at max).

> - UI:   Downlink Timeout

Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a downlink.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to unjoined state.
In the unjoined state the applications specified rejoin method will be used.


### Register TX_POWER_RANGE

> - Request current value: Send d8 (hex) on lora port 2
Set the power index range for fast ADR, LSB = lowest, MSB = highest
Range for each is 16 (DR0/Max power) - 0 (regions best), mixing up
highest and lowest does not matter (firmware always use the highest of the two as the max).
There is a high impact on power consumption to turn this up (lower battery time).
