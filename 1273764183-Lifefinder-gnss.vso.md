## Application Sensors (logical sensors)


### Sensor AIR_HUMIDITY

> - Request current value: Send 05 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Unit: CentiRH%

Air humidity sensor (logical)

### Sensor AIR_TEMPERATURE

> - Request current value: Send 04 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Unit: CentiCelcius

Air temperature sensor (logical)

### Sensor BUTTON

> - Request current value: Send 01 (hex) on lora port 2

> - Type: Enumeration

Physical button readout sensor


### Sensor NFC_FIELD

> - Request current value: Send 08 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Type: Boolean

NFC field present sensor (logical)

## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register GPS_TIME_MAX_AGE

> - Request current value: Send cd (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Device Time Max Age
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Default: 0
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 4294967295
Once this maximum age has passed the device will no longer trust its GPS_TIME and GNSS scans become autonomous.
Also, it will start emitting DEVICE_TIME requests on the LoRaWan network once 80% of this time has passed.
Typically the clock drift is a few seconds per 24 hrs. Gps time should be correct within 30s for good assisted scans.
Outdoor use tends to increase clock drift.


### Register LINKCHECK_TIME

> - Request current value: Send d0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Downlink Timeout
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Min: 300
> - Max: 2592000
> - Default: 86400
Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a downlink.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to unjoined state.
In the unjoined state the applications specified rejoin method will be used.


### Register TX_POWER_RANGE

> - Request current value: Send d8 (hex) on lora port 2
Set the power index range for fast ADR, LSB = lowest, MSB = highest
Range for each is 16 (DR0/Max power) - 0 (regions best), mixing up
highest and lowest does not matter (firmware always use the highest of the two as the max).
There is a high impact on power consumption to turn this up (lower battery time).

> - UI:   TX Power Range
> - Mode: RW
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 65535
> - Unit: 2 bytes
