# Application Lifefinder

## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.
