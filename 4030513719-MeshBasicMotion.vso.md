# Application MeshBasicMotion


## Generic RutioMesh Module

Generic mesh module allowing both lora wan bridging, network extension or
(with a setting) the device to behave as a leaf only module (which is same as a regular
lorawan module should the device be joined to lorawan network).


## ADR dampening and limiting module

Adaptive LoRaWan data rate dampening and limiter module, allows to limit both adaptability rate and worst data rate / output power.
This is intended for fixed-mount devices where radio conditions are not expected to change rapidly.

## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis (threshold) it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis (threshold) degrees C,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


The device will do a join attempt if it is not joined and if button is pressed.


An NFC field can be applied to manually trigger a join attempt


## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.


## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.


The device will always do a LoRaWan join attempt when powered on (which also includes after a restart)

in environments that are relatively static.

### Register TX_POWER_RANGE

> - Request current value: Send d8 (hex) on lora port 2
Set the power index range for fast ADR, LSB = lowest, MSB = highest
Range for each is 16 (DR0/Max power) - 0 (regions best), mixing up
highest and lowest does not matter (firmware always use the highest of the two as the max).
There is a high impact on power consumption to turn this up (lower battery time).
