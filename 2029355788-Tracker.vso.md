## Lower Power Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


### General Temperature Operation

> The temperature is measured every 15 minutes and then processed.

When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading.


### Temperature Alarms

When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


### Current Temperature Reporting

The current temperature is uploaded should the temperature have changed more than the set tempHysteresis


### Average Temperature Reporting

When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


## Roaming module

Enable the device to roam through multiple LoRaWan networks, but changing the last digit of the NwkKey to the
currently set network.


Every 24 hours, the join network is reset to 0 (default)


Should the device enter unjoined state and there are more networks to try, the device will try the next network.


## Motion Triggered Tracking

This application has an emphasis on WiFi scanning for positions, although it also
supports GNSS scans (GPS and Beidou).

Each time motion is detected, or when motion has stopped, the app will start a "scan train".
1) After 1 minute, a limited wifi scan will be run. If it finds the required numnber of WIFI
MAC addresses, these will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
2) At a set minute, a second limited wifi scan will be run. Again, if the required number
of MAC addresses are found, they will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
3) After a set period, a full wifi scan will be run. Again, if the required number
of MAC addresses are found, they will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
4) After a set period, a GNSS scan will be run. At this time the scan train stops.

There is a scan budget allowance every 15 minutes. Should the scan budget run out during
the scanning train, the remaining scans will resume once budget is once again filled.

> For correct functioning of the GNSS functionality
> it is recommended to run the vsm-mqtt-client in the backend to keep clocks in sync
> and GNSS almanac updated on the devices.


Interval based scans are available and if set to a positive value it will restart the scan train
on the set interval. The interval can differ between moving or stationary states.

The application will attempt a join every 24 hours should it not already be
joined.

NFC can be used to manually trigger a join attempt


If NFC is connected to an already joined device, it will indicate with a green LED and trigger a scan train


If the device has a button, pressing the button will blink the application led
green and trigger a scan train.


If the device has a button, pressing the button while not joined will trigger a join attempt.

Should the device have been joined since app start, and it is no longer joined it will try a few
quick join attempts before resuming to the 24 hour rejoin regime.

## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.

## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register GPS_TIME_MAX_AGE

> - UI:   Device Time Max Age
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Default: 0
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 4294967295
Once this maximum age has passed the device will no longer trust its GPS_TIME and GNSS scans become autonomous.
Also, it will start emitting DEVICE_TIME requests on the LoRaWan network once 80% of this time has passed.
Typically the clock drift is a few seconds per 24 hrs. Gps time should be correct within 30s for good assisted scans.
Outdoor use tends to increase clock drift.


### Register LINKCHECK_TIME

> - Request current value: Send d0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Downlink Timeout
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Min: 300
> - Max: 2592000
> - Default: 86400
Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a downlink.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to unjoined state.
In the unjoined state the applications specified rejoin method will be used.


### Register SATELLITE_COUNT

> - Request current value: Send ce (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Unit: integer

Reads as the number of satellites seen in the last GNSS scan.
