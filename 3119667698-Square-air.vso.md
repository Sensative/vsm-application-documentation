# Application Square-air


## Roaming module

Enable the device to roam through multiple LoRaWan networks, but changing the last digit of the NwkKey to the
currently set network.


Every 24 hours, the join network is reset to 0 (default)


Should the device enter unjoined state and there are more networks to try, the device will try the next network.

## Slow Tracker Module

This module enables slow tracking through WIFI scanning or GNSS scans.
For proper functioning the GNSS almanac and device time needs to be kept up-to-date, for instance through NFC application or through enabling the dots-mqtt-client


When the button is pressed, a wifi scan will be done.


Daily when the device is joined, it will attempt a wifi scan.


Weekly, when the device is joined, it will attempt a GNSS scan.


## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.

## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


Every minute, the unit will take a humidity sample.

At an interval of averageHumidityIntervalMinutes the unit will recalculate the average humidity value.

This module is calibrated for the white plastics of Square with no holes.

Every minute, the unit will take a light sample.
At an interval of averageLuxIntervalMinutes the unit will recalculate the average lux value.
If the value of average lux was changed more than the luxTresholdPercent it will send an update.

## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.


The device will do a join attempt if it is not joined and if button is pressed.

## AIR Quality Measurement Module

This module uses the Bosch BSEC library and the Bosch BME68x sensor to measure
and estimate air qualities. Please refer to Bosch sensor documentation for reference.


Once the device is joined, the BSEC library is activated (and the air sensor).


> Note that the first sample uplinked can be from a partial measurement period,
> and should be disregarded.
