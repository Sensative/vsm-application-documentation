# Application Puck-radar


## Roaming module

Enable the device to roam through multiple LoRaWan networks, but changing the last digit of the NwkKey to the
currently set network.


Every 24 hours, the join network is reset to 0 (default)


Should the device enter unjoined state and there are more networks to try, the device will try the next network.


## Radar Application

This application integrates with the acconeer/sweiot radar solution. It provides lorawan transfer of radar data
with certain thresholds (hysteresis) filters to reduce the LoRaWan traffic as necessary for any given application.


The application enables port forwardning between radar module and LoRaWan for control of the radar module.

The application enables the device to start on NFC field.


Any NFC field can be used to trigger joining the device.


Interval average distance is sampled minutely and uploaded should the value be changed
more than distanceHysteresis

## Slow Tracker Module

This module enables slow tracking through WIFI scanning or GNSS scans.
For proper functioning the GNSS almanac and device time needs to be kept up-to-date, for instance through NFC application or through enabling the dots-mqtt-client


When the button is pressed, a wifi scan will be done.


Daily when the device is joined, it will attempt a wifi scan.


Weekly, when the device is joined, it will attempt a GNSS scan.


## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.


## Application Outputs


### Output amplitude (confirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Radar echo amplitude unit

The amplitude value reported by the radar, uplinked if it has been changed more than amplitudeHysteresis since last uploaded value.

### Output averageDistanceAlarm (confirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Bit mask
> - Values:
> -- 0 = No alarm
> -- 1 = Low alarm active
> -- 2 = High alarm active
> -- 3 = Both alarms active (can happen if low level > high level)

If non-zero one or several distance alarms are active. Note that this is
formulated as measured distance from sensor. For other logic, please manage
this on server side (e.g. base alarms on measured distance to a surface with)
a known sensor distance.

*This alarm is only available if the average function is enabled, and it is not more
responsive than the average function*


### Output distance (confirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 0.01
> - Unit: m (Meters)

The distance value reported by the radar, uplinked if it has been changed more than distanceHysteresis since last uploaded value.
Unit of this is meters, resolution is 0.01 m.

### Output distanceAverage (confirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 0.01
> - Unit: m

Average distance during the interval


### Output nfcContactCount (confirmed)

> - Size: 4 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Integer
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 2^30

Number of contacts made through NFC with this device. Used to force the unit
to send an uplink even if radar is turned off.


### Output occupied (confirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Boolean

Some radar methods may report a occupied value, typically 1 if occupancy is detected, or 0 if occupancy is not detected.


### Output radarVoltage_V (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 2 bytes
> - Translation factor: 0.001
> - Unit: V
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 3.6

System voltage as measured during radar scan. This is reported on 24h interval to give indication
of battery status. Should the voltage drop significantly from the nominal voltage over time (see
product manual), it may indicate either a cold (or very hot) temperature - see temperature reports.
If temperature is normal, and voltage stays low, consider exchanging the battery.

Some fluctuations in voltage is normal in operation, do not react to a single or few offset readings.

## Application Sensors (logical sensors)


### Sensor BUTTON

> - Request current value: Send 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: Enumeration

Physical button readout sensor


### Sensor NFC_FIELD

> - Request current value: Send 08 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Type: Boolean

NFC field present sensor (logical)


## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register GPS_TIME_MAX_AGE

> - Request current value: Send cd (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Device Time Max Age
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Default: 0
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 4294967295
Once this maximum age has passed the device will no longer trust its GPS_TIME and GNSS scans become autonomous.
Also, it will start emitting DEVICE_TIME requests on the LoRaWan network once 80% of this time has passed.
Typically the clock drift is a few seconds per 24 hrs. Gps time should be correct within 30s for good assisted scans.
Outdoor use tends to increase clock drift.


### Register LINKCHECK_TIME

> - Request current value: Send d0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Downlink Timeout
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Min: 300
> - Max: 2592000
> - Default: 86400
Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a downlink.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to unjoined state.
In the unjoined state the applications specified rejoin method will be used.
