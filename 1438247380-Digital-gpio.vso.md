# Application Digital-gpio


## Roaming module

Enable the device to roam through multiple LoRaWan networks, but changing the last digit of the NwkKey to the
currently set network.


Every 24 hours, the join network is reset to 0 (default)


Should the device enter unjoined state and there are more networks to try, the device will try the next network.


## Lower Power Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


### General Temperature Operation

> The temperature is measured every 15 minutes and then processed.

When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading.


### Temperature Alarms

When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


### Current Temperature Reporting

The current temperature is uploaded should the temperature have changed more than the set tempHysteresis


### Average Temperature Reporting

When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.

## Slow Tracker Module

This module enables slow tracking through WIFI scanning or GNSS scans.
For proper functioning the GNSS almanac and device time needs to be kept up-to-date, for instance through NFC application or through enabling the dots-mqtt-client


When the button is pressed, a wifi scan will be done.


Daily when the device is joined, it will attempt a wifi scan.


Weekly, when the device is joined, it will attempt a GNSS scan.


## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.

## Application Sensors (logical sensors)


### Sensor BUTTON

> - Request current value: Send 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: Enumeration

Physical button readout sensor

> - Unit: CentiCelcius

Internal temperature on board (not calibrated)

## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register GPS_TIME_MAX_AGE

> - Request current value: Send cd (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Device Time Max Age
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Default: 0
> - Min: 0
> - Max: 4294967295
Once this maximum age has passed the device will no longer trust its GPS_TIME and GNSS scans become autonomous.
Also, it will start emitting DEVICE_TIME requests on the LoRaWan network once 80% of this time has passed.
Typically the clock drift is a few seconds per 24 hrs. Gps time should be correct within 30s for good assisted scans.
Outdoor use tends to increase clock drift.


### Register LINKCHECK_TIME

> - Request current value: Send d0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - UI:   Downlink Timeout
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Min: 300
> - Max: 2592000
> - Default: 86400
Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a downlink.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to unjoined state.
In the unjoined state the applications specified rejoin method will be used.
