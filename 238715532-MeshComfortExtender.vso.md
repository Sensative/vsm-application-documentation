# Application MeshComfortExtender


## Generic RutioMesh Module

Generic mesh module allowing both lora wan bridging, network extension or
(with a setting) the device to behave as a leaf only module (which is same as a regular
lorawan module should the device be joined to lorawan network).

Attempt to join lora every day (if not already joined)
Join lora on power-on

## ADR dampening and limiting module

Adaptive LoRaWan data rate dampening and limiter module, allows to limit both adaptability rate and worst data rate / output power.
This is intended for fixed-mount devices where radio conditions are not expected to change rapidly.

## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis (threshold) it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis (threshold) degrees C,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


Every minute, the unit will take a humidity sample.

At an interval of averageHumidityIntervalMinutes the unit will recalculate the average humidity value.

## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.


The device will do a join attempt if it is not joined and if button is pressed.


An NFC field can be applied to manually trigger a join attempt


## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.


The device will always do a LoRaWan join attempt when powered on (which also includes after a restart)

should the unit fall outside the mesh. It is recommended to set this to longer times in
in environments that are relatively static.

Low pass filter factor. 1 = no low-pass filter. 2 = filter factor 1 (fast) ... 10 = very slow.
When the built-in ADR function propose a new power index, this filter factor is employed in a low pass filter.
If the filter value is set to 1 the algorithm will use its proposed new value (if below or at max).

Set the power index range for fast ADR, LSB = lowest, MSB = highest
Range for each is 16 (DR0/Max power) - 0 (regions best), mixing up
highest and lowest does not matter (firmware always use the highest of the two as the max).
There is a high impact on power consumption to turn this up (lower battery time).
