# Application Linkcheck


## Application Description

> This application uses the built-in feature of running link checks at intervals.

The interval is set as a parameter streamingRate. At random intervals of streamingRate seconds (+-50%)
the device will send a linkCheck confirmed uplink on port 6 (including some data on SNR and RSSI for
the last seen downlink, typically the confirm for the last uplink).

By this the application can measure network quality. Basically no other measures are done by the app.


The application attempts a join every minute (in case it has lost connectivity for a while)


## Application Outputs


## Application Inputs (settings)


### Input linkCheckRate (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Request current value: Send a0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Update value to 1: Send a0 00 00 00 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - *Note: It is highly recommended to ensure that you use higher level applications to update settings so that the correct version of this application is used as reference (these data may change or differ between sensors)*
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Default: 30
> - Min: 2
> - Max: 3600

The average rate at which we do link checks (in seconds), exact timing is randomized


## Application Sensors (logical sensors)


## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register APP_CONFIG

> - Request current value: Send ca (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Bit mask

Enable or disable certain functions of the device, such as power on/off behaviours.


### Register DEVICE_STATE

> - Request current value: Send c8 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Enumeration

Current application state of the device. Can be written by application to affect the devices application state.

> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_UNJOINED (running but not joined to network)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_JOINING (running and attempting to join network)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_JOINED (running and joined to network)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_STREAMING (running and uploading pending data packages)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_ON_RADIO (running and currently working with the radio)
> - DEVICE_STATE_OFF (normally not accessible from VM but possible to write to turn off the device)
> - Others Reserved by runtime

### Register STREAMING_RATE

> - Request current value: Send d6 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds

The average rate at which the device streams data, e.g. delay between lora transactions.
Actual rate is randomized at this value +- 50% to avoid potential repeat collisions, for instance if the device is
triggered by sound or acceleration.
