# Application Linkcheck


## Application Description

> This application uses the built-in feature of running link checks at intervals.

The interval is set as a parameter streamingRate. At random intervals of streamingRate seconds (+-50%)
the device will send a linkCheck confirmed uplink on port 6 (including some data on SNR and RSSI for
the last seen downlink, typically the confirm for the last uplink).

By this the application can measure network quality. Basically no other measures are done by the app.


The application attempts a join every minute (in case it has lost connectivity for a while)


## Application Outputs


## Application Inputs (settings)


### Input linkCheckRate (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Request current value: Send a0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Update value to 1: Send a0 00 00 00 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - *Note: It is highly recommended to ensure that you use higher level applications to update settings so that the correct version of this application is used as reference (these data may change or differ between sensors)*
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Default: 30
> - Min: 2
> - Max: 3600

The average rate at which we do link checks (in seconds), exact timing is randomized
