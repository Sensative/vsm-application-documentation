## Application Outputs


## Application Inputs (settings)


## Application Sensors (logical sensors)


### Sensor BUTTON

> - Request current value: Send 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: Enumeration

Physical button readout sensor


## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register BOARD

> - Request current value: Send c0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: 2 Bytes

Hardware board information

> - Byte 0: PCB Identity (1 = Dots, 2 = Micro, 3 = Air, 4 = Puck)
> - Byte 1: Hardware Tuning (1 = 868MHz, 2 = 915MHz). Some products have common tuning for whole spectra.

### Register LINKCHECK_TIME

> - Request current value: Send d0 (hex) on lora port 2
> Mode: RW
> Unit: seconds
> Min: 300
> Max: 2592000
> Default: 86400
Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a confirmation.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_UNJOINED.


### Register RSSI

> - Request current value: Send d9 (hex) on lora port 2
RSSI for last downlink / join response
> - Mode: R-
> - Unit: dBm

### Register SENSOR_MASK_LO

> - Request current value: Send c3 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: Bit field

Logical sensor mask for the current device (first 32 bits)
