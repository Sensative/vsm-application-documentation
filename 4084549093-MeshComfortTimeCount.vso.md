# Application MeshComfortTimeCount


## Generic RutioMesh Module

Generic mesh module allowing both lora wan bridging, network extension or
(with a setting) the device to behave as a leaf only module (which is same as a regular
lorawan module should the device be joined to lorawan network).

## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


Every minute, the unit will take a humidity sample.

At an interval of averageHumidityIntervalMinutes the unit will recalculate the average humidity value.

The device will do a join attempt if it is not joined and if button is pressed.


An NFC field can be applied to manually trigger a join attempt


## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.


The device will always do a LoRaWan join attempt when powered on (which also includes after a restart)
