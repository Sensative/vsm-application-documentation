## Lower Power Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


### General Temperature Operation

> The temperature is measured every 15 minutes and then processed.

When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading.


### Temperature Alarms

When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


### Current Temperature Reporting

The current temperature is uploaded should the temperature have changed more than the set tempHysteresis


### Average Temperature Reporting

When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


## Roaming module

Enable the device to roam through multiple LoRaWan networks, but changing the last digit of the NwkKey to the
currently set network.


Every 24 hours, the join network is reset to 0 (default)


Should the device enter unjoined state and there are more networks to try, the device will try the next network.

The number of LoRaWan network identities this device shall have.

> The identities are based on the network key, but replacing the last digit of the network key with hexadecimal
value 0-F. In case the device needs to rejoin, it will iteratively attempt join in priority order 0 to roamNetworkCount-1.

no report will be generated (saves battery and radio air time).
