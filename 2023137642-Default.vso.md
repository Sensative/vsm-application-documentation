Only if no other app has been downloaded into the device this application shall be enabled.
A special case is the COMPLIANCE TEST application which will be erased upon successful completion.

After a completed LCTT (Lora compliance test) the compliance application is removed, and it is in that case
which this application is loaded.

The device will join on power on.
