# Application MeshAir


## Generic RutioMesh Module

Generic mesh module allowing both lora wan bridging, network extension or
(with a setting) the device to behave as a leaf only module (which is same as a regular
lorawan module should the device be joined to lorawan network).


Adaptive LoRaWan data rate dampening and limiter module, allows to limit both adaptability rate and worst data rate / output power.

## Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis (threshold) it will upload a new temp reading. The temperatures are polled every minute and then processed.


When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


When the temperature is between the low level


When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis (threshold) degrees C,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


Every minute, the unit will take a humidity sample.

At an interval of averageHumidityIntervalMinutes the unit will recalculate the average humidity value.

## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.


The device will do a join attempt if it is not joined and if button is pressed.


An NFC field can be applied to manually trigger a join attempt


## Daily Rejoin Module

Should the device not be joined, it will try to rejoin on 24hr interval.


The device will always do a LoRaWan join attempt when powered on (which also includes after a restart)

## AIR Quality Measurement Module

This module uses the Bosch BSEC library and the Bosch BME68x sensor to measure
and estimate air qualities. Please refer to Bosch sensor documentation for reference.


Once the device is joined, the BSEC library is activated (and the air sensor).


> Note that the first sample uplinked can be from a partial measurement period,
> and should be disregarded.


Once the device is synchronized to mesh network, the BSEC library is activated (and the air sensor).

should the unit fall outside the mesh. It is recommended to set this to longer times in
in environments that are relatively static.

Set the power index range for fast ADR, LSB = lowest, MSB = highest
Range for each is 16 (DR0/Max power) - 0 (regions best), mixing up
highest and lowest does not matter (firmware always use the highest of the two as the max).
There is a high impact on power consumption to turn this up (lower battery time).
