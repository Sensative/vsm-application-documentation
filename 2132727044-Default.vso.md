# Application Default


## Default Application

Only if no other app has been downloaded into the device this application shall be enabled.
A special case is the COMPLIANCE TEST application which will be erased upon successful completion.

After a completed LCTT (Lora compliance test) the compliance application is removed, and it is in that case
which this application is loaded.

The device will join on power on.
The device will rejoin once a week should it have been unjoined.

## Application Outputs


### Output helloDefaultApp (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes

Single output which would indicate to the user that there is a default app,
as well as meet requirements from LCTT to send something not on test port
after join. No semantic meaning otherwise. Will be sent once per minute for
the first few minutes after power on and join, with data 1 - 10.
