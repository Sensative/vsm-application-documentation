# Application Airport-int

The "Airport-int" application emphasizes motion-triggered positioning through WiFi and GNSS scanning. It activates scans whenever motion is detected or stops, employing a sequence of limited and full scans. The scanning process is governed by a budget, allowing a certain number of scans every 15 minutes to conserve energy. Users can set specific time intervals for scans and define the required number of WiFi MAC addresses to confirm a successful scan. The application aims to efficiently determine the device's location while optimizing battery usage. Overall, it combines multiple scanning methods to enhance positioning accuracy.

## Motion Triggered Tracking

This application has an emphasis on WiFi scanning for positions, although it also
supports GNSS scans (GPS and Beidou).

Each time motion is detected, or when motion has stopped, the app will start a "scan train".
1) After 1 minute, a limited wifi scan will be run. If it finds the required numnber of WIFI
MAC addresses, these will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
2) At a set minute, a second limited wifi scan will be run. Again, if the required number
of MAC addresses are found, they will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
3) After a set period, a full wifi scan will be run. Again, if the required number
of MAC addresses are found, they will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
4) After a set period, a GNSS scan will be run. At this time the scan train stops.

There is a scan budget allowance every 15 minutes. Should the scan budget run out during
the scanning train, the remaining scans will stop unless the budget is once again filled.

> For correct functioning of the GNSS functionality
> it is recommended to run the vsm-mqtt-client in the backend to keep clocks in sync
> and GNSS almanac updated on the devices.

NFC can be used to manually trigger a join attempt
There is a daily rejoin attempt should the device not be joined.
Should the device have been joined since app start, and it is no longer joined it will try a few
quick join attempts before resuming to the 24 hour rejoin regime.

## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.


## Application Outputs


### Output abandonedCart (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: Boolean
Uplinked after abandonedCartTime_minutes minutes.
Should be compared to device position on server to see if it's in a corall or not.

### Output batteryPercent (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Unit: % (estimated)

Estimated remaining % of battery in this unit based on measured use time and power for MCU, Radio, Sensors

Motion sensor reading, one of
- 0 : Unknown
- 1 : Still (less than register MOTION_CONTROL mm/s2 acceleration change detected through last minute)
- 2 : Moving (more than register MOTION_CONTROL mm/s2 acceleration change detected through last minute)
- 3 : Shocked (more than 4m/s2 change in acceleration detected through last minute)

### Sensor NFC_FIELD

> - UI:   Downlink Timeout
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Seconds
> - Min: 300
> - Max: 2592000
> - Default: 86400
Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a downlink.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to unjoined state.
In the unjoined state the applications specified rejoin method will be used.


### Register TX_POWER_RANGE

> - Request current value: Send d8 (hex) on lora port 2
Set the power index range for fast ADR, LSB = lowest, MSB = highest
Range for each is 16 (DR0/Max power) - 0 (regions best), mixing up
highest and lowest does not matter (firmware always use the highest of the two as the max).
There is a high impact on power consumption to turn this up (lower battery time).
