## Lower Power Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


### General Temperature Operation

> The temperature is measured every 15 minutes and then processed.

When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading.


### Temperature Alarms

When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


### Current Temperature Reporting

The current temperature is uploaded should the temperature have changed more than the set tempHysteresis


### Average Temperature Reporting

When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


## Motion Triggered Tracking

This application has an emphasis on WiFi scanning for positions, although it also
supports GNSS scans (GPS and Beidou).

Each time motion is detected, or when motion has stopped, the app will start a "scan train".
1) After 1 minute, a limited wifi scan will be run. If it finds the required numnber of WIFI
MAC addresses, these will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
2) At a set minute, a second limited wifi scan will be run. Again, if the required number
of MAC addresses are found, they will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
3) After a set period, a full wifi scan will be run. Again, if the required number
of MAC addresses are found, they will be uplinked and the scan train stops.
4) After a set period, a GNSS scan will be run. At this time the scan train stops.

There is a scan budget allowance every 15 minutes. Should the scan budget run out during
the scanning train, the remaining scans will stop unless the budget is once again filled.

> For correct functioning of the GNSS functionality
> it is recommended to run the vsm-mqtt-client in the backend to keep clocks in sync
> and GNSS almanac updated on the devices.

NFC can be used to manually trigger a join attempt
There is a daily rejoin attempt should the device not be joined.
Should the device have been joined since app start, and it is no longer joined it will try a few
quick join attempts before resuming to the 24 hour rejoin regime.

## Battery Reporting Module

Battery remaining esimates are measured on a weekly basis.
