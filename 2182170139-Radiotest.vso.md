# Application Radiotest


## Application Outputs


## Application Inputs (settings)


## Application Sensors (logical sensors)


### Sensor BUTTON

> - Request current value: Send 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: Enumeration

Physical button readout sensor


## Application Registers used (device controls)


### Register APP_CONFIG

> - Request current value: Send ca (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Bit mask

Enable or disable certain functions of the device, such as power on/off behaviours.


### Register BOARD

> - Request current value: Send c0 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: 2 Bytes

Hardware board information

> - Byte 0: PCB Identity (1 = Dots, 2 = Micro, 3 = Air, 4 = Puck)
> - Byte 1: Hardware Tuning (1 = 868MHz, 2 = 915MHz). Some products have common tuning for whole spectra.

### Register DEVICE_STATE

> - Request current value: Send c8 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: RW
> - Unit: Enumeration

Current application state of the device. Can be written by application to affect the devices application state.

> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_UNJOINED (running but not joined to network)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_JOINING (running and attempting to join network)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_JOINED (running and joined to network)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_STREAMING (running and uploading pending data packages)
> - DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_ON_RADIO (running and currently working with the radio)
> - DEVICE_STATE_OFF (normally not accessible from VM but possible to write to turn off the device)
> - Others Reserved by runtime

### Register LED

> - Request current value: Send c9 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: -W
> - Unit: Enumeration

Write in order to effect the application LED (not available on all device models)


### Register LINKCHECK_TIME

> - Request current value: Send d0 (hex) on lora port 2
> Mode: RW
> Unit: seconds

Once 80% of this time has passed, the device will make all messages confirmed until it gets a confirmation.
Should this time pass without the device hearing a confirmed response, it will go to DEVICE_STATE_ACTIVE_UNJOINED.


### Register NUMBER

> - Request current value: Send e6 (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RADIO_TEST_CMD

> - Request current value: Send dd (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RADIO_TEST_DATA1

> - Request current value: Send e0 (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RADIO_TEST_DATA2

> - Request current value: Send e1 (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RADIO_TEST_FREQ

> - Request current value: Send de (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RADIO_TEST_HEAD

> - Request current value: Send df (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RADIO_TEST_PARS

> - Request current value: Send e2 (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RADIO_TEST_TIME

> - Request current value: Send e3 (hex) on lora port 2

### Register RSSI

> - Request current value: Send d9 (hex) on lora port 2

### Register SENSOR_MASK_LO

> - Request current value: Send c3 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Mode: R-
> - Type: Bit field

Logical sensor mask for the current device (first 32 bits)


### Register SERIAL

> - Request current value: Send e4 (hex) on lora port 2

### Register SNR

> - Request current value: Send f1 (hex) on lora port 2
