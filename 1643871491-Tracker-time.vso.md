# Application Tracker-time


## Lower Power Temperature Sensing and Reporting Module


### General Temperature Operation

> The temperature is measured every 15 minutes and then processed.

When the sensor detects an air temperature which has changed from the previous uploaded temperature by more than
the set tempHysteresis it will upload a new temp reading.


### Temperature Alarms

When a temperature is detected which exceeds the tempAlarmHighLevel the tempAlarm will be set to 1.


When a temperature is detected which is below the tempAlarmLowLevel the tempAlarm will be set to -1.


### Current Temperature Reporting

The current temperature is uploaded should the temperature have changed more than the set tempHysteresis


### Average Temperature Reporting

When averageTempIntervalMinutes have passed, and if the average temperature has changed more than tempHysteresis degrees,
the sensor will upload a new averageTemp value.


Roaming module

Enable the device to roam through multiple LoRaWan networks, but changing the last digit of the NwkKey to the
currently set network.


Every 24 hours, the join network is reset to 0 (default)


Should the device enter unjoined state and there are more networks to try, the device will try the next network.

> - Update value to 1: Send a0 00 00 00 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - *Note: It is highly recommended to ensure that you use higher level applications to update settings so that the correct version of this application is used as reference (these data may change or differ between sensors)*
> - Unit: Hours
> - Min: 1h
> - Max: 127h
> - Default: 2h

The interval at which average temperature is uploaded (provided that it has changed more than tempHysteresis).


### Input gnssIntervalMinutes (unconfirmed)

> - Unit: Number of networks to attempt joining on in case of rejoin.
> - Min: 1
> - Max: 15
> - Default: 1

The number of LoRaWan network identities this device shall have.

> The identities are based on the network key, but replacing the last digit of the network key with hexadecimal
value 0-F. In case the device needs to rejoin, it will iteratively attempt join in priority order 0 to roamNetworkCount-1.


### Input tempAlarmHighLevel (unconfirmed)

> - Size: 1 bytes
> - Translation factor: 1
> - Request current value: Send a2 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Update value to 1: Send a2 00 00 00 01 (hex) on lora port 2
> - *Note: It is highly recommended to ensure that you use higher level applications to update settings so that the correct version of this application is used as reference (these data may change or differ between sensors)*
> - Unit: C
> - Min: -127C
> - Max: 127C
> - Default: 60C (near product max ambient temperature)

The high level for temperature alarm. Set higher than tempAlarmLowLevel or the alarm function is disabled.


### Input tempAlarmLowLevel (unconfirmed)

> - Translation factor: 1
> - Request current value: Send a1 (hex) on lora port 2
> - Update value to 1: Send a1 00 00 00 01 (hex) on lora port 2

> - Default: 2 C (near freezing point)

The low level for temperature alarm. Set lower than tempAlarmHighLevel or the alarm function is disabled.


### Input tempHysteresis (unconfirmed)

The hysteresis for temperature readings. If temperature changes lower than this value are detected
no report will be generated (saves battery and radio air time).
